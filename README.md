# TriggerAnaTAMaker

Not yet production ready. Need several updates:

1. Configuration files, including a factory to deploy different TA Makers.
2. Provenance
3. Ability to add TAs directly back to the AnaTree files?
4. Build with `triggeralgs`? I don't think this is strictly necessary, but may be nice.
